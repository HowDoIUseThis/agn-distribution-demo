## AGN Distribution Demo App

This demo app is an interactive comparison of the BPT and HeII diagnostic classifiers of galaxies found in SDSS 13 data release.

You can fiddle around with this app on its temporary home on [Heroku](https://dash-agn-demo.herokuapp.com/). It will be a little slow to respond as it is running on a single dyno.



The following are screenshots for the app in this repo:
